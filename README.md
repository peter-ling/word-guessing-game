# word-guessing-game
This file contains a c++ game run in terminal. This game is very similar to hangman, 
where a user can guess characters of a word/phrase and eventually make a guess before 
they run out of wrong guesses.

Creating this game helped me harness my skills in c++ while learning how to utilize input/output and
reading/extracting data from files, It stregnthened my understanding in using data types such as vectors
and unordered sets
