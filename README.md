# word-guessing-game
This file contains a c++ game run in terminal. This game is very similar to hangman, 
where a user can guess characters of a word/phrase and eventually make a guess before 
they run out of wrong guesses.

To play, ensure that the .txt files are in the same location as the HangmanGame.cpp file (this can be done by downloading them all and putting them in the same folder as the HangmanGame.cpp file). 

Creating this game helped me harness my skills in c++ while learning how to utilize input/output and
reading/extracting data from files, It stregnthened my understanding in using data types such as vectors
and unordered sets
